    Title Screen: Simulating an Engine

Step 1: Recording the Audio

    nothing special
        phone's audio recorder.
        placed phone started recording
        
    get clips with steady rpm
    start your engine neutral
        press slightly accelerator 
        rpm to settle.
        repeat 4/5 times, in my case 4 seemed sufficient
        
    another handy thing engine sounds normally for reference
    recording should sound like this

Step 2: Editing the Audio Files
    make suitable for the later steps
    Enable the spectrum 
    Main peak rpm, harmonics
    clip 0.5s
    cross fade loop
    low freq noise
